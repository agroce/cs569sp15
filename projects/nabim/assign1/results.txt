For the implmentation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm, my harness initially asserted the following:

- cost of path is >= 0
- cost of path is <= INFINITY
- all nodes in the path actually exist in the graph
- the path actually begins from the source i.e. path leads from source to destination

CBMC proved the program incorrect for the first assertion i.e. cost of path>=0. Also, if this assertion is suppressed 
and the rest of the assertions are allowed to execute, then CBMC falls into a loop unwinding assertion error while 
verifying the path because if negative edge weights are allowed then CBMC generated a graph where a node had a self loop
which had the least cost. In such a case, trying to traverse the path output by the Dijkstra will be equivalent to traversing 
an infinite loop, so CBMC correctly caught this.

However, if an assumption was added to the harness that all edge weights were >=0, in such a case CBMC was able to successfully
verify the code.

Next, I also asserted the following:
- cost of actually traversing the path is equal to the cost reported by the algorithm

However, I was not able to think of a way to assert the correctness of the "shortest" property of the
path reported by the C program i.e. a way to verify whether the C program was actually returning the
shortest path.
